# Homework 4: Graphs, Queues, Stacks, and Search

## Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to read a representations of directed graphs and do searches over them. We will be using breadth-first and depth first search algorithms.

### Layout/Structure

We will be using enqueue and dequeue processes for the breadth-first search and for the depth-first search we will adapt the breadth-first search by replacing the queue with a stack. Enqueue adds a new element in the queue and dequeue returns and removes a node from the front of the queue. We are given graphsearch.h and hw4.c and we edit the code in grachsearch.c. We are also given multiple graphs as the input.
