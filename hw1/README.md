This directory contains...

  * `Makefile` -- type "make" to build your program
  * `names.h` -- name constants for the pigs
  * `README.md` -- this README
  * `reference_pig` -- a reference implementation of `pig.c` compiled for
    x86-64. We told you not to put compiled binaries in git and then we put a
    compiled binary in git. Rude.

# Input numbers based on prompts given to roll the die and play the game.
## Because of lack of time, the program is not perfect and will not match all the inputs in the referencefile.
